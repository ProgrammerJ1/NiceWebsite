                    <figcaption class="NesInfoText">The NES is an 8-bit gaming console. It was used in the past for early gaming. It stores classics that many would enjoy such as Super Mario Bros. 1-3, Mega Man 1-6, Little Mac, Metroid, .etc. It was very popular in its day, and the games it stored are still beloved to many. There is also a Japanese counterpart called the Famicon, which has a shorter controller cord, but more advanced sound channels. Click on the picture above to access emulators.</figcaption>

You start in the same spot every time you input your password, and in addition, it is nearly impossible to legiatlemely achieve the best ending. The game is also a convulated Metroidvania, which while having some good ideas and potential, makes for an unfun experience for a casual player. I am not as harsh on it because I've always played it the wrong way, however if I did try to play it the right way, I probably would not enjoy it. You must "prossess" all 5 of Dracula's parts and fight him at the end of the game to complete it. You must also game in a specfic time limit of a day and night cycle, which is difficult considering that you need to grind to get specific items to progress.</td>
